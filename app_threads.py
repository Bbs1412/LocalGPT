# This code handles the threads in the LocalGPT
# Image attachment are saved as the file paths in the json files
# Since thread is loaded form the file only once, base64s will be created and attached in the json->st.session_state.messages at that time
# But in rest (in the json saved), only the file paths will be saved
# Now, once thread with base64s is loaded in st, we do not load the json file again and again.
# Instead, st.session_state.messages (thread) is saved repeatedly in the json file
# So, while saving the thread, we will remove the base64s (file paths remain as it is since they were not updated / removed).
